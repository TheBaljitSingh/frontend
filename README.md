# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Here's a template for a `README.md` file for your Event Scheduler project:

# Event Scheduler

Event Scheduler is a React-based web application designed to manage and organize events efficiently. This application allows users to create, edit, and view events with an intuitive interface and provides features like multi-step form creation, dynamic progress tracking, and sliding image carousels for event displays.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly design using Tailwind CSS.


## Usage

1. **Create an Event:**
   - Click on the "Create Event" button.
   - Fill in the details in the multi-step form.
